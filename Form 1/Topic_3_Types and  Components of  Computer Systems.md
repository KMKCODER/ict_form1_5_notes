# TYPES AND COMPONENTS OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM.

### Computer Hardware
Computer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system. These are the tangible parts you can see and touch, which work together to enable the computer to function. Hardware is distinct from software, which consists of programs, applications, and data that run on the hardware.
Key Categories of Computer Hardware:

### 1. CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU)
The CPU (Central Processing Unit), often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, is the primary component responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations in a computer system. It interprets and carries out the basic operations required to run software and manage hardware.
#### Key Functions of a CPU:
- **Fetch:** Retrieves instructions from memory (RAM).
- **Decode:** Interprets the instructions into a form the CPU can understand.
- **Execute:** Performs the required calculations or operations.
- **Store:** Writes the results back to memory or sends them to an output device.
#### Components of a CPU:
- **Control Unit (CU):**
Manages the flow of data and instructions within the CPU.
Coordinates activities between the CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):**
Performs mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical operations (comparisons, decisions).
- **Registers:**
Small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data and instructions temporarily during processing.
- **Cache Memory:**
A small amount of highspeed memory located on or near the CPU to store frequently accessed data, speeding up processing.
### 2. MEMORY
**RAM** (Random Access Memory) and **ROM** (ReadOnly Memory) are two types of computer memory that serve different purposes in a computer system.
#### RAM (Random Access Memory)
#### Definition:
RAM is temporary storage for data and instructions actively being used by the CPU. RAM is a type of volatile memory, meaning it loses its data when the power is turned off. It stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly while the computer is running. Acts as the computer's short-term memory. Stores active programs, operating system processes, and data currently in use.
#### Characteristics:
- **Fast Access:** RAM allows for quick read/write operations, making it ideal for temporary storage.
- **Volatile:** Data is erased when the computer is powered off.
- **Upgradable:** The amount of RAM in a system can often be increased to improve performance.
### ROM (Read Only Memory):
#### Definition:
ROM is permanent storage for firmware or BIOS, used during the boot process. ROM is a type of nonvolatile memory, meaning it retains its data even when the power is turned off. It is used to store permanent or semi-permanent data that does not need to be modified. Stores firmware or software that is essential for booting up the computer and initializing hardware.
#### Characteristics:
- **Non-Volatile:** Data is retained even without power.
Read-Only: Data is typically prewritten and cannot be easily modified (though some types of ROM allow limited updates).
Permanent Storage: Used for critical system instructions.

### 3. STORAGE DEVICES
Storage devices are hardware components used to store, retrieve, and save data permanently or temporarily in a computer system. They provide the means to keep data even when the computer is powered off, unlike volatile memory like RAM. Storage devices vary in terms of capacity, speed, and portability.
#### Secondary Storage Devices:
Used for permanent storage of data, even when the computer is turned off. Examples: Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), USB Flash Drives, Memory Cards.
#### a) Hard Disk Drive (HDD):
- Uses spinning magnetic disks to store data.
- Advantages: High capacity, cost-effective.
- Disadvantages: Slower than SSDs, mechanical parts can fail.
- Example: 1TB HDD.
#### b) Solid State Drive (SSD):
- Uses flash memory to store data (no moving parts).
- Advantages: Faster, more durable, energy-efficient.
- Disadvantages: More expensive per gigabyte than HDDs.
- Example: 500GB SSD.
#### c) USB Flash Drive:
- Portable storage device that connects via USB.
- Advantages: Small, portable, easy to use.
- Disadvantages: Limited capacity compared to HDDs/SSDs.
- Example: 64GB USB drive.
#### d) Memory Cards:
- Used in cameras, smartphones, and other portable devices.
- Advantages: Compact, portable.
- Disadvantages: Limited capacity and durability.
- Example: 128GB SD card.
#### e) Optical Discs:
- Use lasers to read/write data.
- Types: CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs.
- Advantages: Inexpensive, portable.
- Disadvantages: Limited capacity, prone to scratches.
- Example: 4.7GB DVD.

### 4. INPUT DEVICES
Input devices are hardware components that allow users to interact with a computer by sending data or commands to the system. They are essential for entering information, controlling operations, and communicating with the computer.
#### Common Input Devices:
#### a) Keyboard:
- Used to input text, numbers, and commands.
- Types: QWERTY, ergonomic, mechanical, virtual (on-screen).
- Example: Typing a document or entering a password.
#### b) Mouse:
- A pointing device used to control the cursor on the screen.
- Types: Optical, laser, wireless, trackball.
- Example: Clicking icons, dragging files, or scrolling.
#### c) Touchscreen:
- Allows users to interact directly with the display by touching it.
- Common in smartphones, tablets, and kiosks.
- Example: Tapping an app icon or swiping through photos.
#### d) Scanner:
- Converts physical documents or images into digital format.
- Types: Flatbed, sheet-fed, handheld.
- Example: Scanning a photo or document.
#### e) Microphone:
- Captures audio input and converts it into digital data.
- Used for voice commands, recording, and communication.
- Example: Voice typing or video calls.
#### f) Webcam:
- Captures video input for communication, recording, or surveillance.
- Example: Video conferencing or live streaming.
#### g) Joystick:
- A gaming input device used to control movement in games.
- Example: Playing flight simulators or racing games.
#### h) Trackpad:
- A touch-sensitive pad used to control the cursor, commonly found on laptops.
- Example: Moving the cursor or performing gestures.
#### i) Graphics Tablet:
- Allows users to draw or write directly onto a surface, which is then digitized.
- Example: Digital art creation or handwriting recognition.
#### j) Barcode Reader:
• Scans barcodes to input product information.
• Example: Scanning items at a retail store.
#### k) Biometric Devices:
• Input devices that capture biological data for authentication.
• Examples: Fingerprint scanners, facial recognition cameras.
#### l) Game Controller:
- Used for gaming, with buttons, joysticks, and triggers.
- Example: Xbox or PlayStation controllers.
#### m) Light Pen:
- A light-sensitive input device used to draw or select objects on a screen.
- Example: Used in graphic design or CAD applications.
#### n) Touchpad:
- Similar to a trackpad, used for cursor control on laptops.
- Example: Navigating a laptop without a mouse.
#### o) Stylus:
- A pen-like device used for drawing or writing on touchscreens or graphics tablets.
- Example: Taking notes on a tablet or drawing on a digital canvas.
#### Functions of Input Devices:
- Enable users to enter data (text, numbers, commands).
- Allow interaction with software and applications.
- Facilitate communication between the user and the computer.
- Support specialized tasks like gaming, design, or data capture.
